Numpy is the core library for scientific and numerical computing in python.

It provides high-performance multidimentional array object and tools for working with arrays.

Numpy main objective is the multidimentional array.

It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers.

In numpy, dimensions are called axes


Why should we use Numpy array when we have python list? 
1) Numpy Array is Very optimized when compared with python list.
2)It also uses less memrory. So, it's optimize both for speed and memory use.
